Archive 'Reflash_*.7z' updates both 'factory' and 'image-a' images.
1) Extract and copy contents to /mnt/src/ (microSD card) installed in target MK5
2) 'reboot', or cycle power
3) LEDs will cycle to 'ORANGE' 3 times, indicating 'update in progress'.
4) Monitor update progress using 'ping' command if desired.  Expect the process to take 4-8 minutes, including (3) reboots.
5) Be patient. *DO NOT* interrupt power during update process.
