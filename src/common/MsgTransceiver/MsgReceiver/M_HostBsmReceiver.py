  Created by: Niraj Vasant Altekar
  University of Arizona   
  College of Engineering
  This code was developed under the supervision of Professor Larry Head
  in the Systems and Industrial Engineering Department.
  
  Operational Description:
  This application does the following tasks:
  1. Reads the hostIp and port of this application from a configuration file.
  2. Creates a socket, and binds it to the information retrieved from the configuration file.
  3. Receives the BSMs over the socket.
  4. Extracts the BSM payload and forwards the payload to TransceiverDecoder.
