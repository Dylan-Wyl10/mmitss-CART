SnmpEngine.cpp
Created by: Niraj Vasant Altekar
University of Arizona   
College of Engineering

This code was developed under the supervision of Professor Larry Head
in the Systems and Industrial Engineering Department.

***************************************************************************************

Description:
------------
SnmpEngine utilizes the c++ net-snmp library that facilitates the interaction with 
target Snmp devices. This class provides an API for the following:
 (1) Establishing the SNMP session with the target SNMP device (in the constructor)
 (2) Process and execute the SnmpSet or SnmpGet request.

Complete official tutorial on building a C++ application for SnmpSet and SnmpGet
requests is available at: 
http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/TUT:Simple_Application

    IMPORTANT NOTE:
    ---------------

    In MMITSS, only the required portion of NetSnmp libraries is precompiled. 
    Due to this, the some MIBs are not present in this custom distribution. 
    Therefore, at the start of the application following warnings are expected:

    =============== WARNINGS END ===============

    These warnings do not affect the working of this applciation, as we do not use any 
    of the MIBs that are not available. If one wishes to suppress these warnings,
    set the following environment variable:
    MIBS=ALL

    this can be accomplished by entering following command in the terminal before starting 
    the application:
    export MIBS=ALL
