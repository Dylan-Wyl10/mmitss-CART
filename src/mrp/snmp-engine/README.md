# SNMP-ENGINE
SNMP is one of the widely accepted protocols to manage and monitor network elements. All NTCIP compliant traffic actuated signal controllers can be managed and monitored using the SNMP protocol.  

[Net-SNMP](http://www.net-snmp.org/) library provides APIs that can be used to communicate with such devices over IPv4 or IPv6.
