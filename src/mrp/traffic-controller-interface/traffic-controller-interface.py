This code was developed under the supervision of Professor Larry Head
in the Systems and Industrial Engineering Department.

***************************************************************************************

Description:
------------
This is a wrapper module for the traffic controller commander software. It performs
following functions:
(1) Listens for messages from other MMITSS components
(2) If the received message is a schedule:
    - If the schedule is a clear request, it clears the BackgroundScheduler and 
        clears all NTCIP commands from the signal controller.
    - If the schedule is a new schedule, it is processed and appropriate commands
        are added to the BackgroundScheduler.
(3) If the message is a request for current and next phases, this module formulates a 
    json string containing the information about current and next phases, and sends it to 
    the requestor.
(4) If the message is a request for current timing plan, then send the current timing 
    plan stored in the SignalController object.
