# MMITSS Driver Model for VISSIM Microscopic Simulation

To simulate connected vehicles in VISSIM simulation, the MMITSS driver-model allows vehicles using this driver-model to send their dynamic state information to a configured network node at every simulation timestep (10 Hz). 

## Work-Flow:
The vehicle state information is packed in a Binary Large Object (Blob) whose structure is defined [here](./../README.md)


## Console Output and Logging
The driver-model neither produces any console output nor generates any log files.

## Configuration

## Requirements

## Known Issues/Limitations
