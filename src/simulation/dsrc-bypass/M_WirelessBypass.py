  M_WirelessBypass.py  
  Created by: Niraj Vasant Altekar

  This code was developed under the supervision of Professor Larry Head
  in the Systems and Industrial Engineering Department.

  Description:
  In the simulation environment of MMITSS, it is often infeasible to route messages 
  through actual wireless devices such as RSU or OBU. M_WirelessBypass application 
  serves as a bypass that takes in the message created by the MessageEncoder
